🧱 About This Repository

This repository is a small showcase of my journey learning front-end fundamentals — how to structure pages, manage layouts, and style clean UIs without JavaScript or frameworks.
Each folder represents an individual project built from scratch, focused on a single concept like navigation, grid layout, or responsive design.
